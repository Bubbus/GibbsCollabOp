BRIEFING (long-form for slotting post):
-----------------------------------

It has been 17 months since the 2022 elections in Al-Rayak, and their results remain in dispute. The country has splintered into bloody civil war, with three dominant factions arising from the chaos to claim legitimacy. 
The United Nations Operation in Al-Rayak (UNORAY) began three months ago after several suicide bombings took the single largest civilian death toll in recent history.  
Operating alongside loyalist forces in accordance with international recognition, UN peacekeepers have transformed contested urban areas into ceasefire towns in the first steps towards de-escalation. As outlined in the UNORAY mission brief, each faction is afforded a partition of the town in exchange for peace in the common area.
As open war rages outwith the Dayr Hafir city limits, contention stirs within as each faction goads the others to breach the ceasefire.  It's a peace that can't last, but one you must maintain.
